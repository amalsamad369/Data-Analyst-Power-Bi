#  Production Cost & Operations Dashboard (Excel)

## Dashboard Type  
Microsoft Excel – Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers & Interactive Dashboard

---

## Problem Statement  

The purpose of this project is to analyze **production operations and cost efficiency** using structured data stored in Microsoft Excel. The dashboard helps stakeholders understand how production cost, output quantity, task distribution, and managerial workload vary across different **products, time periods, and managers**.

By transforming raw production data into an interactive Excel dashboard, this project enables decision-makers to monitor operational performance, identify high-cost areas, analyze productivity trends, and support data-driven planning and cost optimization.

## Data Source  

The dataset was sourced from an **Excel workbook** containing production-related records such as:
- Product Type  
- Production Cost  
- Units Produced  
- Number of Tasks  
- Manager Name  
- Year and Month  

The data represents operational performance across multiple periods and product categories.

## Steps Followed  

- **Step 1:** The production dataset was loaded into Microsoft Excel and reviewed for structure and consistency.  
- **Step 2:** Basic data cleaning was performed by verifying numeric fields, handling missing values, and standardizing column names.  
- **Step 3:** Pivot Tables were created to calculate key metrics such as total production cost, total units produced, and task count.  
- **Step 4:** A Pivot Table was used to analyze **Total Production Cost by Product Type**, enabling cost comparison across categories.  
- **Step 5:** Another Pivot Table was created to evaluate **Task Distribution by Manager**, helping identify workload imbalance.  
- **Step 6:** Time-based analysis was performed to understand **Units Produced by Month and Year**.  
- **Step 7:** Additional calculations were used to derive **Average Production Cost per Unit** for each product category.  
- **Step 8:** Pivot Charts such as column charts and bar charts were added to visually represent each analysis.  
- **Step 9:** **Excel Slicers** were added and connected to all Pivot Tables to enable dynamic filtering by:
  - Product Type  
  - Manager  
  - Year  
  - Month  
- **Step 10:** All visuals were arranged into a single interactive dashboard with clear titles and proper alignment.  
- **Step 11:** Formatting and layout enhancements were applied to improve readability and provide a professional look.
